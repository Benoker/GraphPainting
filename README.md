GraphPainting
=============
GraphPainting is a little library that can be used to paint uml-diagrams (and other stuff).

This library is published under the GPL licence, so you are free to use it.

Please note, the developers do not offer any help or advice in how to actually use the library - simply because
they are only interested in writing new features, and do not care about maintenance.
